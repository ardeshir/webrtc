Web Real-Time Communications is revolutionizing the way users communicate, collaborate, and create. WebRTC adds standard APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and built-in real-time audio and video capabilities and codecs to browsers without a plug-in. With JavaScript, developers can add high quality peer-to-peer voice, video, and data channel communications to their collaboration, conferencing, telephony, and gaming applications.
